#### [[C201171-21] Create User Stories](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-21) ####
[User stories](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/22-23-ce201-col/22-23_CE201-col_team-07/-/blob/62c7456425e6075ab45b284a574080835c39212e/MVP/RequirmentsAndRiskLog9/UserStories)
During my time in week one I initially created code for “Hello word” and added my name into our group deposit which contributed to the team getting used to and understanding git and java.
I also made a start on user story’s which most of us have made one which can be seen by clicking the link. My story helped to create a foundation of understanding that helped throughout my time in the project and as time went along, I began developing the user story even further.
The user story also allowed me to come up with features and functions that the user wanted to see in the program before it was created. Once again this added to the understanding of our end goal and helped me to create something whilst keeping in mind the specific needs on what was expected by the user.

#### [[C201171-4] Create user interface component to select multiple items from a list](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-4) ####
[Project Management](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/22-23-ce201-col/22-23_CE201-col_team-07/-/blob/94eeada61ab1f91cd446f7645fc94c23d5bb8f68/MVP/ProjectMangement.md)
During this sprint I made began making some interface GUI components that contained a button on screen as well as a simple foundation to build upon. This was a major task to start as it would lead our team into further developing our code into an MVP. It also helped having a GUI created early as it helped us visualise our end goal and program easier.
In my free time I also began on our product management, which is part of the MVP, this was something extra I started as a task in Jira to begin both coding and documentation tasks. This was good as I added to it as we went through with the project making it more reliable than doing everything last minute.

#### [[C201171-3] Parse CSV dataset into java](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-3) ####
[Product Demo](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/22-23-ce201-col/22-23_CE201-col_team-07/-/blob/481c81992d37efd20d81e058b320deedd7ac3ab7/MVP/ProductDemonstration.md)
This task was created for me to create code that would take the data from the csv file and implement it into the initial program we had created. For example, my code read the csv file and used a button once clicked to load the data initially. This was then taken further and developed to have data being plotted on a graph rather than only loading it with a button. I also added features and functions that I was happy with.


### Thomas Youngman ###

#### [[C201171-21] Creating User Stories](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-21) ####
During week 1 and 2, we were getting to know each other as team members and familiarising ourselves with Git and Jira and I added some code to "Hello world".
In week 3, I created a user story detailing a user persona and what they would want the program to do, it took 1 hour.

#### [[C201171-32] Risk - User Risk](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-32) ####
This week I worked on describing and researching the risks a GUI that is not user-friendly could cause. It took 1 hour.

#### [[C201171-30] Risk - Redundant Code](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-30) ####
This week I also worked on describing and researching the risks that redundant code could cause. This took 1 hour.

#### [[C201171-27] Risk Assessment](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-27) ####
This task was to work on the risk assessment section of the Risk Assessment and Requirements markdown documentation required for the MVP which took a total of 2 hours.


### Toby Sawyer ###

#### [[C201171-15] create "HelloWorld" in java](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-15) ####
In the first meeting I created a simple HelloWorld java file. The project files were then commited to git where each of the other team members could then pull the changes, add their own name, and push the change to cseegit.

#### [[C201171-2] Create user interface component for plotting graphs](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-2) #### 
This task involved finding a free and open source Java library for plotting graphs, and implementing it into the project. Ultimately we settled on using the JFreeChart library and created a simple plot without any data.

#### [[C201171-6] Process CSV data ready for graphing](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-6) ####
At this point in the project student data was being loaded into the program but was totally unused. This task involved looping the loaded data and formatting it for the JFreeChart scatter plot.
