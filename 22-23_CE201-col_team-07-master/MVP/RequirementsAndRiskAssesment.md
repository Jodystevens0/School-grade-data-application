# Risk Assessment #
## Risks identified: ##


1. Redundant Code – [https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-30]

Description: Redundant Code can lower efficiency and make the code harder to read and edit therefore we need to have someone proof-reading and commenting the code that is stored in our GitLab project.
Impact: By commenting and proof-reading our code, we can raise efficiency and help ourselves in the future if we need to edit past code.
Likelihood that this Risk will affect us: High

2. Miscommunication between Team Members – [https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-31]

Description: Miscommunication can cause misunderstandings and lower the efficiency of the group meaning that the group produces less output.
Impact: By keeping communication between team members consistent, we can make sure everyone is up to date and we can make sure that everyone is contributing to the project evenly.
Likelihood that this Risk will affect us: Medium
This story has not been assigned to anyone as the responsibility to update other members depends on who missed sessions and the story has not been completed as it is an ongoing task.


3. User Risk – [https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/C201171-32]

Description: Users can be impatient and can cause the program to break if not careful.
Likelihood that this Risk will affect us: Medium
Mitigating Actions: to mitigate this risk, we can make the GUI more user-friendly like removing buttons once they have been pressed to avoid users forcing the program to run methods multiple times.
This story has not been assigned to anyone yet but will likely be assigned to whoever creates and optimises the GUI and the story has not been completed yet.
